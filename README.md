# RAILWAY-TRACK-CRACK-DETECTION
This project uses an Arduino Uno-based embedded system with three IR sensors to detect railway track cracks in real time. It distinguishes cracks from natural gaps and triggers alerts via buzzer/LED. The system replaces slow manual inspection and serves as a base for future GPS/GSM-enabled upgrades.

OBJECTIVES:
Design a cost-effective, embedded crack detection system
Utilize a 3 IR sensor configuration to increase detection accuracy
Eliminate reliance on GPS/GSM in the initial stage
Provide a scalable platform for further enhancements

FEATURES:
Real-time crack detection using three IR sensors
Eliminates false alarms by filtering natural gaps(18mm)
Arduino Uno handles signal acquisition and decision logic
Buzzer/LED-based local alert mechanism
Portable and suitable for test rigs or future onboard deployment

TECH STACK:
Embedded C Programming
Arduino Uno 
Triple IR Sensor Array for multi-point surface monitoring
Real-Time Decision Logic

WORKING PRINCIPLE:
The three IR sensors continuously scan the railway track.
If two or more sensors detect a drop in reflected IR signal (indicating a crack), it is validated.
Arduino Uno processes this input and triggers a buzzer or LED.
The system automatically resets to continue monitoring.

IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS:
Challenge: Distinguishing real cracks from natural gaps
Solution: Use of 3 IR sensors and threshold-based validation logic
Challenge: Noise in sensor readings
Solution: Debouncing, filtering, and calibration techniques

NEW LEARNINGS:
Interfacing and synchronizing multiple IR sensors
Real-time validation using sensor redundancy
Embedded circuit design and real-time responsiveness on Arduino Uno

LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK:
Current version lacks real-time location tracking
Not tested under high-speed rail movement or harsh weather

Future Enhancements Include:
Integration of GPS and GSM modules for real-time location-based alerts
Cloud-based data logging and predictive maintenance analytics
AI-assisted crack pattern recognition
Miniaturization for direct locomotive integration
