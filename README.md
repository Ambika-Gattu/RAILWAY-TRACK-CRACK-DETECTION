# RAILWAY-TRACK-CRACK-DETECTION
This project uses an Arduino Uno-based embedded system with three IR sensors to detect railway track cracks in real time. It distinguishes cracks from natural gaps and triggers alerts via buzzer/LED. The system replaces slow manual inspection and serves as a base for future GPS/GSM-enabled upgrades.
