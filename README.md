# RAILWAY-TRACK-CRACK-DETECTION
This project uses an Arduino Uno-based embedded system with three IR sensors to detect railway track cracks in real time. It distinguishes cracks from natural gaps and triggers alerts via buzzer/LED. The system replaces slow manual inspection and serves as a base for future GPS/GSM-enabled upgrades.

OBJECTIVES:
<br>
Design a cost-effective, embedded crack detection system
<br>
Utilize a 3 IR sensor configuration to increase detection accuracy
<br>
Eliminate reliance on GPS/GSM in the initial stage
<br>
Provide a scalable platform for further enhancements
<br>

FEATURES:
<br>
Real-time crack detection using three IR sensors
<br>
Eliminates false alarms by filtering natural gaps(18mm)
<br>
Arduino Uno handles signal acquisition and decision logic
<br>
Buzzer/LED-based local alert mechanism
<br>
Portable and suitable for test rigs or future onboard deployment
<br>

TECH STACK:
<br>
Embedded C Programming
<br>
Arduino Uno 
<br>
Triple IR Sensor Array for multi-point surface monitoring
<br>
Real-Time Decision Logic
<br>

WORKING PRINCIPLE:
<br>
The three IR sensors continuously scan the railway track.
<br>
If two or more sensors detect a drop in reflected IR signal (indicating a crack), it is validated.
<br>
Arduino Uno processes this input and triggers a buzzer or LED.
<br>
The system automatically resets to continue monitoring.
<br>

IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS:
<br>
Challenge: Distinguishing real cracks from natural gaps
<br>
Solution: Use of 3 IR sensors and threshold-based validation logic
<br>
Challenge: Noise in sensor readings
<br>
Solution: Debouncing, filtering, and calibration techniques
<br>

NEW LEARNINGS:
<br>
Interfacing and synchronizing multiple IR sensors
<br>
Real-time validation using sensor redundancy
<br>
Embedded circuit design and real-time responsiveness on Arduino Uno
<br>

LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK:
<br>
Current version lacks real-time location tracking
<br>
Not tested under high-speed rail movement or harsh weather
<br>

Future Enhancements Include:
<br>
Integration of GPS and GSM modules for real-time location-based alerts
<br>
Cloud-based data logging and predictive maintenance analytics
<br>
AI-assisted crack pattern recognition
<br>
Miniaturization for direct locomotive integration
